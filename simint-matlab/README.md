# MATLAB Interface for Simint

Files in this directory mainly comes from repo [simint-matlab](https://github.com/gtfock-chem/simint-matlab). 



Note:
On my workstation (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, GCC 5.4.0, ICC 17.0.4, MATLAB R2017b), the mex functions can be compiled with GCC 5.4.0, but it seems that Simint need to be compiled with GCC instead of ICC.
